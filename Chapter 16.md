# Chapter 16: The Molecular Basis of Inheritance

- List all the classes of enzymes involved in DNA replication.
  - Helicases
  - Single-strand binding proteins
  - Topoisomerase
  - Primase
  - DNA polymerase
  - Ligase
  - Nucleases
- What is the purpose of the released pyrophosphate?
- What direction does DNA elongate?
  - 5' to 3' on the synthesized strand.
  - The template strand is thus read from 3' to 5'.
- Why is the lagging strand synthesized discontinuously?
- What is the purpose of DNA ligase?
  - Forms the phosphodiester bond between two adjacent nucleotides (ligates nucleotides together).
- What does a nuclease do? What is an endonuclease? What is an exonuclease?
  - A nuclease cuts DNA: endonuclease cuts DNA in the middle of the strand, while exonucleases cut DNA at the end of the strand.

# Chapter 16: The Molecular Basis of Inheritance

- What is DNA replication's error rate?
- How did the Meselson-Stahl experiment verify the semiconservative model of DNA replication?
- List all the classes of proteins involved in DNA replication.
  - Helicases
  - Single-strand binding proteins
  - Topoisomerase
  - Primase
  - DNA polymerase
  - Ligase
- What is the purpose of the released pyrophosphate?
- What direction does DNA elongate?
  - 5' to 3' on the synthesized strand.
  - The template strand is thus read from 3' to 5'.
- Why is the lagging strand synthesized discontinuously?

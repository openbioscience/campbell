# Chapter 16: The Molecular Basis of Inheritance

- What is DNA replication's error rate?
- How did the Meselson-Stahl experiment verify the semiconservative model of DNA replication?
- List all the classes of proteins involved in DNA replication.
  - Helicases
  - Single-strand binding proteins
  - Topoisomerase
  - Primase
  - DNA polymerase
  - Ligase
  - Nucleases
- What is the purpose of the released pyrophosphate?
- What direction does DNA elongate?
  - 5' to 3' on the synthesized strand.
  - The template strand is thus read from 3' to 5'.
- Why is the lagging strand synthesized discontinuously?
- What is the purpose of DNA ligase?
  - Forms the phosphodiester bond between two adjacent nucleotides (ligates nucleotides together).
- What does a nuclease do? What is an endonuclease? What is an exonuclease?
  - A nuclease cuts DNA: endonuclease cuts DNA in the middle of the strand, while exonucleases cut DNA at the end of the strand.
- What are the two kinds of DNA repair discussed in this chapter?
  - **mismatch repair.** repair during the replication process
  - **nucleotide excision repair.** repair after damage has occurred
- What happens when DNA repair mechanisms fail?
  - Diseases develop, most common of which is cancer.
- What would happen if DNA replication and repair was perfect (no errors)?
  - No mutations would be possible.
- What is the purpose of telomeres?
  - Telomeres account for the sections of DNA that cannot be replicated in a linear chromosome.
- How do cancer cells abuse telomerase?
  - Telomerase extends telomeres, which enables a cell to divide endlessly as the chromosome will never shorten enough to be considered damaged by the internal cell machinery.

# 18. Regulation of Gene Expression

## 18.1 Bacteria often respond to environmental change by regulating transcription
- Why is gene regulation necessary?
- What are the two levels of metabolic control?
  - Activity of enzymes
  - Synthesis of enzymes
- What is an operon?
  - An operon is one mechanism for the control of gene expression. It consists of the operator, promoter, and controlled genes.
- Distinguish the operator from the promoter.
- What is an activator?
  - A protein that binds to DNA and stimulates transcription of a gene.
- Describe the function of cAMP and CAP as a line of code.
- Describe the function of the lac repressor as a line of code.
- What is the "opposite" of a corepressor?
- What is the "opposite" of a repressor?
- Do inducers and activators interact?
- Do corepressors and activators interact?
- Distinguish the operator from the repressor.

## 18.2 Eukaryotic gene expression is regulated at many stages
- What are the two reasons for regulating gene expression?
  - Respond to signals in environment
  - Maintain cell specialization in multicellular organisms
- Why is gene expression often used to refer to regulation of transcription?
  - Regulation of transcription is a very common way for a wide range of organisms to respond to external signals.

### Regulation of Chromatin Structure
- What is a nucleosome?
- What are the three kinds of histone modifications, and what are their effects?
- What is the difference between histone and DNA modifications?
  - Histone modifications alter histones, which changes chromatin structure; DNA modifications modify the DNA, which can directly affect the DNA or indirectly via the chromatin.
- What is epigenetic inheritance?
  - Inheritance of traits transmitted by mechanisms no directly inolving the nucleotide sequence.
- Describe the etymology of the word "epigenetic".

### Regulation of Transcription Initiation
- What is the promoter?
  - A specific nucleotide sequence that binds RNA polymerase.
- What is a control element?
  - Any segment of noncoding DNA that serves as a binding site for a transcription factor.
- What is an enhancer?
  - A group of distal control elements
- What are the different kinds of transcription factors?
  - General transcription factors
  - Specific transcription factors
    - Activators
    - Repressors
- What is the general structure of a transcription factor?
  - DNA binding domain and an activation (protein-binding) domain.
- How is it possible that enhancers only bind one or two specific transcription factors, when control element sequences are not unique?
  - Combinations of control elements in enhancers determine which transcription factor can bind; this leads to an exponential number of options.
- How do different cell types express different genes?
  - Different tissues have different activators present, which bind to different enhancers, expressing different genes.
- What does "coordinately controlled genes" mean?
  - Genes that work together to perform some function; they need to be controlled together, so that all gene products are present.
- How are genes coordinately controlled in prokaryotes (i.e. bacteria)?
  - Operons
- How are genes coordinately controlled in eukaryotes?
  - Genes that should work together share the same set of control elements.

### Mechanisms of Post-Transcriptional Regulation

#### RNA processing
- What is alternative RNA splicing?

#### mRNA degradation
- How does the cell control the rate of mRNA degradation?
  - Nucleotide sequences on the 3'-UTR end of the molecule
- Why are the globin mRNAs stable, while growth factor mRNAs quickly degrade?

#### Initiation of Translation
- What is interesting about the fact that both the 5' cap and the poly-A tail are important for ribosome binding?
  - They are the beginning and the end of the RNA; both ends are checked, not just the front.
- What are two ways to block initiation of translation?
  - Binding regulatory proteins to the 5' or 3' end of the mRNA.
  - Keeping poly-A tails short.

#### Protein processing and degradation
- What is the proteasome?
- List three kinds of protein processing.
  - Cleavage
  - Phosphate
  - Sugars
- How is a protein marked for degradation?
  - Ubiquitination

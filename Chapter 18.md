# 18. Regulation of Gene Expression


## 18.1 Bacteria often respond to environmental change by regulating transcription

- Why is gene regulation necessary?
- What are the two levels of metabolic control?
  - Activity of enzymes
  - Synthesis of enzymes
- What is an operon?
  - An operon is one mechanism for the control of gene expression. It consists of the operator, promoter, and controlled genes.
- Distinguish the operator from the promoter.

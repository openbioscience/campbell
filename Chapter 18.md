# 18. Regulation of Gene Expression

## 18.1 Bacteria often respond to environmental change by regulating transcription
- Why is gene regulation necessary?
- What are the two levels of metabolic control?
  - Activity of enzymes
  - Synthesis of enzymes
- What is an operon?
  - An operon is one mechanism for the control of gene expression. It consists of the operator, promoter, and controlled genes.
- Distinguish the operator from the promoter.
- What is an activator?
  - A protein that binds to DNA and stimulates transcription of a gene.
- Describe the function of cAMP and CAP as a line of code.
- Describe the function of the lac repressor as a line of code.
- What is the "opposite" of a corepressor?
- What is the "opposite" of a repressor?
- Do inducers and activators interact?
- Do corepressors and activators interact?
- Distinguish the operator from the repressor.

## 18.2 Eukaryotic gene expression is regulated at many stages
- What are the two reasons for regulating gene expression?
  - Respond to signals in environment
  - Maintain cell specialization in multicellular organisms
- Why is gene expression often used to refer to regulation of transcription?
  - Regulation of transcription is a very common way for a wide range of organisms to respond to external signals.

### Regulation of Chromatin Structure
- What is a nucleosome?
- What are the three kinds of histone modifications, and what are their effects?
- What is the difference between histone and DNA modifications?
  - Histone modifications alter histones, which changes chromatin structure; DNA modifications modify the DNA, which can directly affect the DNA or indirectly via the chromatin.
- What is epigenetic inheritance?
  - Inheritance of traits transmitted by mechanisms no directly inolving the nucleotide sequence.
- Describe the etymology of the word "epigenetic".

### Regulation of Transcription Initiation
- What is the promoter?
  - A specific nucleotide sequence that binds RNA polymerase.
- What is a control element?
  - Any segment of noncoding DNA that serves as a binding site for a transcription factor.
- What is an enhancer?
  - A group of distal control elements
- What are the different kinds of transcription factors?
  - General transcription factors
  - Specific transcription factors
    - Activators
    - Repressors
- What is the general structure of a transcription factor?
  - DNA binding domain and an activation (protein-binding) domain.

### Mechanisms of Post-Transcriptional Regulation

## 18.3 Noncoding RNAs play multiple roles in controlling gene expression

## 18.4 A program of differential gene expression leads to the different cel types in a multicellular organism

## 18.5 Cancer results from genetic changes that affect cell cycle control

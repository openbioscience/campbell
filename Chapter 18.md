# 18. Regulation of Gene Expression

## 18.1 Bacteria often respond to environmental change by regulating transcription

- Why is gene regulation necessary?
- What are the two levels of metabolic control?
  - Activity of enzymes
  - Synthesis of enzymes
- What is an operon?
  - An operon is one mechanism for the control of gene expression. It consists of the operator, promoter, and controlled genes.
- Distinguish the operator from the promoter.
- What is an activator?
  - A protein that binds to DNA and stimulates transcription of a gene.
- Describe the function of cAMP and CAP as a line of code.
- Describe the function of the lac repressor as a line of code.
- What is the "opposite" of a corepressor?
- What is the "opposite" of a repressor?
- Do inducers and activators interact?
- Do corepressors and activators interact?
- Distinguish the operator from the repressor.

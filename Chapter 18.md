# 18. Regulation of Gene Expression

## 18.1 Bacteria often respond to environmental change by regulating transcription
- Why is gene regulation necessary?
- What are the two levels of metabolic control?
  - Activity of enzymes
  - Synthesis of enzymes
- What is an operon?
  - An operon is one mechanism for the control of gene expression. It consists of the operator, promoter, and controlled genes.
- Distinguish the operator from the promoter.
- What is an activator?
  - A protein that binds to DNA and stimulates transcription of a gene.
- Describe the function of cAMP and CAP as a line of code.
- Describe the function of the lac repressor as a line of code.
- What is the "opposite" of a corepressor?
- What is the "opposite" of a repressor?
- Do inducers and activators interact?
- Do corepressors and activators interact?
- Distinguish the operator from the repressor.

## 18.2 Eukaryotic gene expression is regulated at many stages
- What are the two reasons for regulating gene expression?
  - Respond to signals in environment
  - Maintain cell specialization in multicellular organisms
- Why is gene expression often used to refer to regulation of transcription?
  - Regulation of transcription is a very common way for a wide range of organisms to respond to external signals.

### Regulation of Chromatin Structure
- What is a nucleosome?
- What are the three kinds of histone modifications, and what are their effects?
- What is the difference between histone and DNA modifications?

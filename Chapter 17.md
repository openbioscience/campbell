# Chapter 17. From Gene to Protein

- What is gene expression?
  - Gene expression is the process by which DNA directs the synthesis of proteins (or RNAs).
- What important fact did Beadle and Tatum discover?
  - The function of genes is to dictate the production of specific enzymes.
  - In other words, genes control phenotype through proteins.
- What is minimal medium?
- Where does transcription take place in a eukaryotic cell?
- What is pre-mRNA?
- What is the template strand?
- What is the coding strand?
- In what direction is mRNA read?
- Why do some polypeptides not begin with methionine?
- What is a reading frame?
  - The triplet groupings of nucleotides that is read by ribosomes during translation.

## 17.2, Transcription is the DNA-directed synthesis of RNA
- What is the promoter?
- What do transcription factors do?
- How does termination differ between bacteria and eukaryotes?

## 17.3, Eukaryotic cells modify RNA after transcription
- Where does RNA processing take place?
  - In the nucleus.
- What purposes do the 5' cap and 3' poly-A tail serve?
  - Facilitate export of mature mRNA to the cytoplasm
  - Protect mRNA from degradation by hydrolytic enzymes
  - Help ribosome attach to mRNA in the cytoplasm
- What are UTRs? What is their purpose? Are they part of exons or introns?
  - Untranslated regions: portions of the mature mRNA that are not translated into protein
  - They help bind the RNA to ribosomes.
  - UTRs are part of exons.
- What are introns? What are exons?
- Which makes up a greater portion of pre-mRNA transcripts: introns or exons?
- What are snRNPs? What are snRNAs?
  - snRNPs are RNA-protein complexes that make up the splicesome.
  - The RNA in snRNPs are called snRNAs: they help recognize splice sites and catalyze RNA splicing.
- Why does the existence of ribozymes provide strong evidence for the origin of life as an RNA world?
- What is alternative RNA splicing?
- What is a protein domain?
- How might introns enhance evolution?
